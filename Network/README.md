# Network Assessment Kit
The Network Assessment Kit (NAK) stores tools and equipment to assist with network assessments. Tools for network assessments can get rather large and bulky, such as switches and packet capturing devices. Thus the equipment will vary by the components involved with the assessment. Use project scoping time to understand the types of network medium (i.e. copper, fiber) and network speed (i.e. 1 Gigabit per second, 10 Gigabit per second) that will be evaluated. The following kits are a generic list to get people started.
