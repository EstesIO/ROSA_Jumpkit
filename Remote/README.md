# Remote Assessment Kit

The Remote Assessment Kit (VAK) stores tools and equipment to assist with remote assessments. Remote assessments require tools that are sent to the client to provide access and conduct testing of the internal network. This equipment is typically sent to the client from the office. Road Warriors, however, may find themselves needing to be prepared to send a client a remote device or drop one off to a client. In either case, having a prepped case for shipping or deployment is preferred. The following kits are a generic list to get people started.

NOTE: Equipment changes over time. It is natural that that some of the equipment listed in these kits will be dated and, possibly, discontinued. Equipment is useful until new functionality is required or something more consistent is identified. All kits should be viewed as good starting points.
