# Hardware Assessment kit
The Hardware Assessment Kit (KAT) stores tools and equipment to assist with hardware assessments. Tools for hardware assessments can get rather large and bulky, such as chip debuggers or multimeters. Thus the equipment will vary by the components involved with the assessment. Use project scoping time to understand the types of hardware interfaces and components (i.e. microcontrollers and memory) that will be evaluated. The following kits are a generic list to get people started.

# Kit 1 - Multimeter
This will list the basic equipment, wire, and other things needed to help to conduct a hardware assessment.

# Kit 1 - Basic Hardware Component Interactions
This will list the basic equipment, wire, and other things needed to help to conduct a hardware assessment.
