# Hardware Assessment kit
The Hardware Assessment Kit (KAT) stores tools and equipment to assist with hardware assessments. Tools for hardware assessments can get rather large and bulky, such as chip debuggers or multimeters. Thus the equipment will vary by the components involved with the assessment. Use project scoping time to understand the types of hardware interfaces and components (i.e. microcontrollers and memory) that will be evaluated. The following kits are a generic list to get people started.

# Kit 1 - Multimeter
This will list the basic equipment, wire, and other things needed to help to conduct a hardware assessment.


| Equipment | Vendor | Model | Description | Quantity | Cost* | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| [Extech EX330 Multimeter](http://www.extech.com/display/?id=14823) | Extech | EX330 | Multimeter to understand voltages, connectivity, and tone-out leads. | 1 | $51 | This is typically not optional. May or may not come with lead wires. |
| [Multimeter Electronic Test Lead Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Extech-TL809-Electronic-Test-Lead/dp/B0012VWUI6) | Extech | TL809 | Leads are the wires used with the multimeter | 1 | $17 | The normal posts are necessary and the alligator clips are extremely valuable to use with smaller bits of wire for probing. |
| [Hook-up Wire Spool - Red](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8865) | Sparkfun | PRT-08865 | Hook-up Wire | 1 | $3 | Red to use with red multimeter lead. Just put a small six to twelve inch piece in case with leads. Store spool with equipment or in another kit. |
| [Hook-up Wire Spool - Black](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8867) | Sparkfun | PRT-08867 | Hook-up Wire | 1 | $3 |  Black to use with black multimeter lead. Just put a small six to twelve inch piece in case with leads. Store spool with equipment or in another kit. |
