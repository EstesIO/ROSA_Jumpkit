# Physical Assessment Kit

The Physical Assessment Kit (PAK) stores tools and equipment to assist with physical assessments. These tools include bump keys, lock picks, RFID readers, and other entry tools. The following kits are a generic list to get people started.

NOTE: Equipment changes over time. It is natural that that some of the equipment listed in these kits will be dated and, possibly, discontinued. Equipment is useful until new functionality is required or something more consistent is identified. All kits should be viewed as good starting points.
