# Forensic Assessment Kit

The Forensic Assessment Kit (FAK) stores tools and equipment to assist with data acquisition and forensic assessments. Data acquisition and forensic assessments require tools that are specialized to the media on which the data is stored. The following kits are a generic list to get people started.

* [FAK: Basic Remote Assessment](./README.md#fak-basic-forensic-assessment)
  * [FAK: Basic Forensics Future Upgrades Wishlist](./README.md#fak-basic-forensics-future-upgrades-wishlist)

NOTE: Equipment changes over time. It is natural that that some of the equipment listed in these kits will be dated and, possibly, discontinued. Equipment is useful until new functionality is required or something more consistent is identified. All kits should be viewed as good starting points.
