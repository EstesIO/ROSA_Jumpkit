# Wi-Fi Assessment Kit

The Wi-Fi Assessment Kit (WAK) stores tools and equipment to assist with assessments of 802.11-based networks. Tools for Wi-Fi assessments can get rather large and bulky, such as network adapters and access points. Thus the equipment will vary by the components involved with the assessment. Use project scoping time to understand the types of [802.11 networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11) (i.e. AC, N, G) that will be evaluated. The following kits are a generic list to get people started.

NOTE: Equipment changes over time. It is natural that that some of the equipment listed in these kits will be dated and, possibly, discontinued. Equipment is useful until new functionality is required or something more consistent is identified. All kits should be viewed as good starting points.
