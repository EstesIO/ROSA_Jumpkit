# Radio Assessment Kit
The Radio Assessment Kit (RAK) stores tools and equipment to assist with radio and wireless network assessments. Radio assessments can involve a gambit of implementations. The tools required need to help locate radio transmissions, identify implementation, capture transmissions, and support interaction with the wireless network. The following kits are a generic list to get people started.

NOTE: Equipment changes over time. It is natural that that some of the equipment listed in these kits will be dated and, possibly, discontinued. Equipment is useful until new functionality is required or something more consistent is identified. All kits should be viewed as good starting points.
